<strong>Overview</strong>


By using the GIPHY API I was be able to create a fun web page that populates all different types of exercises. It was designed to give me some inspo to work out when really all I want to do is curl up on the couch and watch Netflix and eat pizza! 


Called on the GIPHY API and used JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.
